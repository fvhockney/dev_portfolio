        I believe in the simplicity. Simplicity should not be thought of negitively. In true simplicity, there is no deficiencies or insufficiencies. Simplicity is the abscence of obfuscation. Simplicity should be conceived of as a certain form of elegence and beauty. A simple thing may be complex, but in order for a complex thing to conform to the standards of simplicity, it must be devoid of any elements which are not strictly necessary for its function. I allow this concept to guide my daily life. When writing, speaking, or programming, I strive for simplicity.
