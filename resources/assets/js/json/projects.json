      "descriptionLong": "<p>The sudden and mysterious termination of two African-American university employees roiled the black community at Northern Kentucky University and eventually set <em>The Northerner</em> at odds with the university's administration. This article is a result of multiple weeks of investigation utilizing open records requests and interviews in an attempt to discern what actually happened. The staff continued to investigate and follow this story after publication, and very nearly ended up in litigation with the university over a lack of transperency.</p><p>Writing this article presented myriad problems. Their was considerable push-back from both the administration, who did not wish to be seen in a bad light, and the two terminated employees, who wished to present themselves only in the best light. While this is understandable, journalistic ethics required that both parties be presented in as fair and complete a way as possible. Despite repeated attempts to be swayed one way or the other by the parties involved, I am convinced that Mr. Call and I followed our ethical guidlines.<p>This article received a third place KIPA award as part of an on-going investigation into the termination of these employees and the university's conduct.</p><h4>According to the award:</h4><blockquote class='blockquote'>These reporters did a great job of following the firing of two staff members. Good use of e-mails, public records and using the African-American student retention rate. Thought the second story could have been more concise, but the subheads helped.<blockquote>"

Additionally, it utilizes an administration panel for uploading the blog posts and managing the comments.</p><p>After version 1.0, in which I used almost completely custom CSS, I decided to use the newly released Bootstrap 4 CSS. The main reason was to streamline the amount of time needed to write css and to provide consistent user experience throughout. It also helped to make the website more mobile friendly, although admittedly Bootstrap is not a cure all. There are still a few bugs on small resolution screens I need to address. Bootstrap also has some limitations with its sizing (w-*) utility.</p><p>I utilize very little javascript on the client facing portion of the site. It made sense to forego some of the web2.0 experiences since my target audience, Germany, has a higher than average number of users who disable javascript. Additionall, my customers are likely to be older and more security concious, meaning they may disable javascript. The comments section, however, <em>is</em> built on javascript, namely Vue.</p><p>The website also leverages a number of additional packages to add functionality and minimize reinventing the wheel.</p>"

      "descriptionLong": "<p>This website is written almost entirely in Vue.js. Why? This site seemed like a perfect opportunity to create a SPA. It has a relatively flat hierarch with virtually no additional server calls needed. The only place, in fact, that needs to call the server is the contact page, and that server call is easily handled by axios. By creating the SPA, I can tap into the power of javascript to add a more fluid transformation between pages.</p><p>The portfolio page is the only page which is really 'data driven', but Vue does a nice job of handling the data and making it easy to expand as the portfoli grows. While Vue offers the ability to store the state in a store, I opted for the simpler JSON object which is then imported into the component. I see no reason to add the additional dependencies of Vuex when I am not really modifying the store. However, if I should add additional functionality in the future which makes Vuex necessary, then the JSON object is easily ported into the store and a minimal amount of refactoring is required to prevent the page from breaking.</p><p>I also use the vue-bootstrap library. This library allows me to use the Bootstrap 4 components and styles that I like while decoupling from all of the additional Bootstrap dependencies, like Jquery! I can further reduce the size of the files by manually importing only those components which I need from both vue-bootstrap and the Bootstrap.scss.</p>"

As part of the idea generation process, I decided to work on some designs for our theoretical agency. It was also a good excuse to practice using Inkscape, a FOSS vector graphics program.</p><p>The ''Fernweh'' font is hand-built. This would, ideally, be used on a letter head or as a text logo. The goal was to evoke a sense of flight and ocean-like movment &mdash; two things we both associate with Israel. We also wanted it to be clean and a bit edgy.</p><p>The box logo with the outline of Israel was an early attempt at integrating the text with a visual logo. Israel has some great wineries, so I took inspiration from wine lables to create this. The outline of Israel was traced by hand. The ''israel'' font was not drawn by me.</p><p>The four circular graphics are various attempts to create a logo based on what my friend conceived. The stork is quite often associated with Israel, and he has always been struck by the beauty of the sunsets there. The stork is traced from a CCO photo and the form has been manipulated somewhat.</p>"
